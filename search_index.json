["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Keto No-Fry Buffalo Cauliflower", " Chapter 2 Keto No-Fry Buffalo Cauliflower Ever had the incredible Buffalo Cauliflower from Erewhon? If you haven’t, you MUST! They are probably the first thing that is sold out everytime we shop…THEREFORE I decided to make our own…without the deep fryer! They also use rice flour (which is da bomb) but for a more keto friendly recipe simply replace with almond flour ;) So here you have it- a simple guide to making Vegan, Gluten-free, Keto, No-Fry Buffalo Cauliflower. Pals and I just so happen to love these on a rainy days here in LA! This way to yum… Time: 35 Mins. Yields: Roughly two cups Ingredients: ½ head of Cauliflower 1 egg ½ cup Buffalo sauce (my favorite, “Red Wings”) ½ stick of butter (substitute vegan butter, my favorite “Miyoko’s”) 1 cup almond flour ½ tsp garlic salt Steps: For Cauliflower: Preheat oven to 450 degrees Wash and break cauliflower into pieces, let air dry Beat egg with a fork or whisk Toss the cauliflower pieces into egg Top with Almond flour and garlic salt (we like to use a Ziplock bag to toss dry ingredients thoroughly). Lay on sheet pan with pan liners or foil with a cooking spray. Nothing touching to cook evenly Bake for 25 minutes or until golden For sauce: Melt butter/vegan butter Add in buffalo sauce Whisk or stir thoroughly Pour on top of golden cauliflower. Serve with hemp-ranch dipping sauce (click here for recipe) Lol, even the boy said these were ahhhhmazing! Besos &amp; Besos! -Cassarivera "],
